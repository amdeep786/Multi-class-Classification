# Multi-class-Classification

In this work, thw aim of the neural network is to classify the type of flower displayed in an image. Hence, multi-class classification is employed for the same. Also, an additional another hidden layer to the network is added to evaluate, if it can increase the classification accuracy. At last, teh metwork implements exponential learning rate decay.
